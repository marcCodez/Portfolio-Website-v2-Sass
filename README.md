For the final project of the Modern HTML & CSS course I created a Portfolio and finally had a taste of Sass. It is such a powerful tool that I will definetly consider utilising again in my future projects. To restate once again, after completing Brad Travery's JavaScript course which I thorougly enjoyed, I felt like I was doing my self a huge disservice by not completing his HTML/CSS course. It turned out to be worth it even though revisiting the same concepts would become tedious, I was still able to fill the gaps in my front end knowledge and build on top of it. I feel like I can make approach html and css more confidently and make mature design decisions as a result of the completion of this course.
